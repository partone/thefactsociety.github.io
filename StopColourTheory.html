      <span style="color:#495c32"><b>THEORY</b> </span>
      is a concept that was contrived in the 18th century by various European thinkers as a means of <b>controlling</b> the way we see the world around us.<sup><a target="_blank" href="https://programmingdesignsystems.com/color/a-short-history-of-color-theory/index.html">1</a></sup>
      <br><br>
      Colour Theory is an <b>intentionally</b> convoluted and enigmatic system that fabricates relationships between colours through systemic classification and hierarchy.
      <br><br>
      The majority have learned to accept Colour Theory as a universal truth thanks to our flawed education system.  Classroom activities are devised to lead children to the conclusion that Colour Theory is a correct and applicable way of understanding and mixing colours.<br><br>Furthermore, organisations such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Illumination">International Commission on Illumination</a> have made it their goal to keep Colour Theory at the forefront of colour science.

            <div class="lieExplanation">
              Most people wouldn't flinch when saying that <b>black</b> is a colour, but this hasn't been true for most of human history.
              <br><br>
              Darkness is the absence of light - yet how can a colour such as <b>black</b> be viewed under natural or artificial light when it is defined as the absence of light?  It is strange to consider that our eyes need light to see colours, yet we see black in complete darkness.
              <br><br>
              It wasn't until the late Middle Ages that the concept of <b>black</b> being a colour began to exist.  It was later adopted into subtractive Colour Theory as the final output of mixing all colours together<a target="_blank" href="https://partone.github.io/StopColourTheory.html"><sup>4</sup></a>.
              <br><br>
              We must ask ourselves whether <b>black</b> is truly a colour, or a concept that exists outside of colour that has been misconstrued in order to legitmise traditional Colour Theory.

              <div class="lieExplanation">
                Light and dark, <i>white</i> and <b>black</b>.  If these word pairs seem naturally linked, it's likely you have been exposed to Colour Theory.  If we read into these words a little more we may begin to notice a slight discord in their relationship.
                <br><br>
                Think of the darkest, most opaque thing you can; maybe you're think of a deep ditch or a night with no moon, things that could accurately be represented with the colour palette that Colour Theory affords us.
                <br><br>
                Now think of the lightest, brightest thing you can.  You probably thought of the sun.  The sun was our first light source and continues to be our fount of daily illumination yet, how is it represented using traditional Colour Theory?  Vey poorly.
                <br><br>
                I have never been blinded by the sun in Van Gogh's <a style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" href="StopColourTheory/images/WheatfieldWithAReaper.jpg">Wheatfield with a Reaper</a> or seen a shadow cast in the presence of <a style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" href="StopColourTheory/images/StarryNight.jpg">Starry Night</a>.  Most people use light/dark terminology while still believing that colour is limited in its ability to portray actual light. This is one of the many deceptions that Colour Theory has taught a large part of the population not to question.

            "But those aren't colours!" you may be thinking.  Ask yourself why you believe that transparent and reflective aren't colours and your answer will be that Colour Theory denies their status.

            The realm of colour beyond Colour Theory recognises the existence of colours unrestrained by the yoke of the colour wheel.  Colour fact is based on unfiltered observation into the realm of colour.

            <div class="lieExplanation">There exists the belief within Colour Theory that all colours occupy a place within the spectrum of visible light, and that each one emits a certain wavelength in respect to its frequency which we perceive as a certain colour.  However, let's delve deeper into the term "frequecy".
            <br><br>
            <span style="color:#9834eb"><b>Violet</b></span> occupies the highest frequency of the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" href="StopColourTheory/images/VisibleSpectrum.jpg">visible light spectrum</a> with a whopping frequency of 668-789THz<a target="_blank" href="http://labman.phys.utk.edu/phys222core/modules/m6/The%20EM%20spectrum.html"><sup>6</sup></a>.  With such a tremendous frequency, you would expect <span style="color:#9834eb"><b>violet</b></span> to be everywhere - but in reality, it's not found in the natural world with great prevalence.  Lavender, eggplant, grapes, and amethysts are among the few naturally occuring <span style="color:#9834eb"><b>violet</b></span> things.
            <br><br>
            <span style="color:#37912c"><b>Green</b></span>, on the other hand, should logically have an incredibly high frequency considering that most of the world's landmass is covered in some form of vegetation<a target="_blank" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/global-maps/MOD_NDVI_M"><sup>7</sup></a>, yet it occupies the middle range.  What about <b>black</b> that doesn't even appear on the visible light spectrum yet is prevalent throughout the entirety of space and is (claimed to be) a colour?

            <div class="lieTitle">Mixing all the colours together produces black...or was it white?</div>
            <div class="lieExplanation">What many people fail to realise about traditional Colour Theory is that there are two opposing schools of thought.  Subtractive Colour Theory tells us that mixing all colours produces <b>black</b> while additive Colour Theory tells us that mixing all colours produces <i>white</i> <a target="_blank" href="https://lucaskrech.com/blog/index.php/2010/01/22/color-theory-basics-additive-and-subtractive-color-mixing/"><sup>8</sup></a>.
            <br><br>
            Much like the Great Schism<a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/event/East-West-Schism-1054"><sup>9</sup></a> divided Christianity, Colour Theory was also divided in its early stages.  In 1850, Hermann Von Helmholtz introduced additive Colour Theory to the already existing subtractive Colour Theory<a target="_blank" href="https://designblog.rietveldacademie.nl/?p=68381"><sub>10</sub></a>.  Whether Helmholtz's creation was an imperfect copy or intentional distinction from traditional Colour Theory is unknown.
            <br><br>
            However, unlike the branches of Christianity, additive and subtractive Colour Theory are both present in mainstream culture and their differences are rarely questioned.  How can seemingly identical colour theories produce completely opposite results?

    <div class="sectionDescriptionLarge sectionDescriptionShort">
    <b>Colour Fact</b> is a straight-forward, scientific system for modelling the realm of colour.
    <br><br>
    Unike Colour Theory, Colour Fact was born from an interest in learning the true nature of colour and opposes the use of colour as a form of propaganda or indoctrination.  Colour Theory has limited our perception of colour in order to restrain thought not only in art, but also in everyday life.
    <br><br>
    Colour Fact is a journey of relearning in which the harness of Colour Theory is removed and we discover our innate ability to see and experience colours as they truly exist beyond the colour wheel.
    <br><br>
    In the following section we outline the six fundamentals of Colour Fact.

While it is true that there is an infinite number of colours, each colour is different and incomparable to another.  For example, <span style="color:#ffa82e"><b>orange</b></span> is not <span style="color:#d6b018"><b>yellower</b></span> than <span style="color:#b81a1a"><b>red</b></span>.

        Colours can be identified by their colour capacity and colour volume
      </div>
      <div class="factExplanation">
        <b>Colour capacity</b> is the quality of matter that dictates the colour it can reach when its colour volume reaches its physical limit.  Colour capacity is defined by the chemical composition of an object.  Colour capacities are generally named after the colour they achieve at full colour volume.
        <br><br>
        <b>Colour volume</b> is the degree of colour present in an object.  Although it is called a volume, it actually represents a number of individual classifications that may seem continuous at first glance, but are separable on closer inspection.  Over time, an object's colour volume may increase or decrease but will never go beyond its colour capacity.

        <div id="nailDemoExplanation">Two nails: One brand new, one rusted.  A colour theorist would tell you the rusted nail has changed colour.  A Fact Society memeber would inform you that both nails are the same colour capacity, but the colour volume of the rusted nail is lower than that of the new one due to exposure to the trasparent colour of air.
        <br><br>
        Exposure to other colours can change the colour volume of an object.  For example, white clothes often increase in colour volume when washed with clothes of other colours.  Plastic objects exposed to the bright colour of the sun for long periods of time often change in colour volume<a target="_blank" href="StopColourTheory/images/SunPlastic.jpg"><sup>12</sup></a>.</div>

        <b>Black</b> exists as a foundation for colour; no colour can exist without first being <b>black</b> and increasing in colour volume from there.  <b>Black</b> is what ocurrs when colour volume is zero.
        <br><br>
        <b>Black</b> as a colour is a concept fabricated by Colour Theory.  Dark colours exist but are absolutely independent to black, they do not approximate blackness.

This is akin to how a colour must be referred to by its volume and capacity for someone to know which colour is being referenced with precision.  No colour capacity contains all colours and no colour exists exclusively on one colour capacity.

          <div id="orangeJuiceExplanation">
            A very common colour capacity (and colour!) is <i>reflective</i>.  It includes the colour of mirrors, polished steel, and <span style="color:#ffa82e"><b>oranges</b></span>.  Due to colour theory conditioning, <span style="color:#ffa82e"><b>oranges</b></span> may seem to be a sore thumb in this list.  The fact is that mirrors and polished steel generally have very high colour volumes, almost to full capacity, whereas <span style="color:#ffa82e"><b>oranges'</b></span> colour is the same colour capacity but with a mid-range colour volume.  Establishing which colours belong to a colour capacity is a challenging task that requires observation and/or experimentation under control conditions.
            <br><br>(Remember that transparent can refer to both the colour and the colour capacity!)

    <div class="sectionDescriptionLarge">
      The <b>Fact Society</b> is a small group of young individuals who seek to independently investigate and analyse concepts and events that mainstream society take as fact.
      <br><br>
      We use our site to publish our findings.  Sometimes our findings simply demonstrate that accpeted conventions are true; sometimes we uncover <i>facts beyond the facts</i>.
      <br><br>
      Our investigations are independent and our investigators have a commitment to fairness and neutrality.  We currently have a policy of non-interventionism for the following ongoing conflicts:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Kashmir conflict (1947-present)</li>
        <li>Insurgency in Balochistan (1947-present)</li>
        <li>Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1965-present)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      We hope this publication has been informative and we encourage you to spread the knowledge with others.  Happy fact seeking!
