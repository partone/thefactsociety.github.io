      NEW ORLEANS, LA - With Bicycle Day soon approaching, people all over the globe will be indulging in the ilicit
      pastime of recreational LSD.
      <br><br>
      Colloquially known as "acid", <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/special-topic/substance-use-lsd"
        target="_blank">LSD</a> is a hallucinogenic drug that triggers that alters
      the user's sensory experiences - distorted sense of time and space, mood changes, uncontrollable thoughts, and
      disconnection from reality are just some of the potential negative effects.
      <br><br>
      <span class="bold">Drowing on LSD: Fact or Fable?<br /></span>
      Wihle investigating the effects of LSD, I recurringly encountered long lists of the various psychotropic symptoms
      of the drug along with briefer notes on the well documented physical effects - enlarged pupils, sleeplessness,
      shaking, etc.
      <br><br>
      However, little, if any, case studies have been performed on humans to determine how LSD affects a person's
      ability to swim and breathe underwater.
      <br><br>
      There exists a plethora of news articles (<a
        href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/fidelity-executive-drowned-in-croatia-after-taking-lsd-inquest-hears-20181219"
        target="_blank">1</a>,
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-38812545" target="_blank">2</a>, <a
        href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/news/129533157/woman-likely-drowned-after-taking-hallucinogenic-drugs-coroner-finds"
        target="_blank">3</a>)
      covering cases of drowning victims who were found to have had LSD in their systems (and often other substances),
      however there is a
      failure to mention in almost all of the articles whether the victim was under the influence at the time of
      drowning.
      <br><br>
      While it is easy to attribute death in these cases to an abuse of drugs, it is wise to note that drugs such as caffeine, steroids, creatine, and others are well documented to improve performance in physical tasks and it may not be so easy judge LSD without proper investigation.
      <br><br>
      A clue to whether it is possible to drown on LSD may come from our mammalian cousins - the dolphin.  Throught the 1960s, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scientists-dolphins-lsd-communitcate-with-them-experiment-talk-john-lilly-margaret-howe-lovatt-a7787556.html">NASA experimented with giving LSD to dolphins</a> and, while the experiments weren't particularly fruitful, they also reported no deaths among the dolphins who, throughout the experiment, lived in an artificial marine environment.  While these experiments don't confirm our hypothesis, they reveal that some mammals may be able to endure substantial lengths of time in the water while 'tripping' on the substance - an ability that may extend to humans.
      <br><br>
      <span class="bold">The Verdict<br/></span>
      Unfortunately, the jury remains out on whether it is possible to drown on LSD due to a lack of scientific evidence.  We can't condemn LSD as a hazard to swimming safety, nor can we praise it as a foolproof swimming safety instrument.
      <br><br>
      As Bicycle Day approaches, it is crucial to celebrate safely and responsibly. Awareness and precaution can help prevent tragic accidents and ensure that the day remains a joyous occasion for all involved.
