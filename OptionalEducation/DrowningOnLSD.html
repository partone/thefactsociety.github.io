      New Orleans, LA - With Bicycle Day soon approaching, people all over the globe will be indulging in the ilicit
      pastime of recreational LSD.
      <br><br>
      Colloquially known as "acid", <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/special-topic/substance-use-lsd"
        target="_blank">LSD</a> is a hallucinogenic drug that triggers that alters
      the user's sensory experiences - distorted sense of time and space, mood changes, uncontrollable thoughts, and
      disconnection from reality are just some of the potential negative effects.
      <br><br>
      <span class="bold">Drowing on LSD: Fact or Fable?<br /></span>
      Wihle investigating the effects of LSD, I recurringly encountered long lists of the various psychotropic symptoms
      of the drug along with briefer notes on the well documented physical effects - enlarged pupils, sleeplessness,
      shaking, etc.
      <br><br>
      However, little, if any, case studies have been performed on humans to determine how LSD affects a person's
      ability to swim and breathe underwater.
      <br><br>
      There exists a plethora of news articles (<a
        href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/fidelity-executive-drowned-in-croatia-after-taking-lsd-inquest-hears-20181219"
        target="_blank">1</a>,
      <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-38812545" target="_blank">2</a>, <a
        href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/news/129533157/woman-likely-drowned-after-taking-hallucinogenic-drugs-coroner-finds"
        target="_blank">3</a>)
      covering cases of drowning victims who were found to have had LSD in their systems (and often other substances),
      however there is a
      failure to mention in almost all of the articles whether the victim was under the influence at the time of
      drowning.
