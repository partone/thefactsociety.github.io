            SAN MATEO, CA - When I was fourteen, my father took me to White Sands National Park in New Mexico.  That trip is when I first discovered my sentience and when I began to be proud of being alive.
            <br><br>
            What is sentience?  You might be thinking it’s the quality of having senses, i.e. being able to feel the physical world.
            <br><br>
            But what is sentience really?
            <br><br>
            For me sentience is observing the yellowness of a banana, getting tummy aches, and feeling the cold water of a calm river.
            <br><br>
            What I saw in White Sands National Park was insentience.
            <br><br>
            I grew up around my parents, my dogs, classmates, flies (in the summer!), and other generally sentient beings.  Nevertheless, around my town there was a large variety of inanimates that I would see in my day-to-day, from pencils to grocery stores, tiny succulents to towering palm trees.
            <br><br>
            However, although I lived in a veritable melting pot, the focus of our pride was always honed in favor of other qualities.  In school we were taught to be proud Americans, at home we were taught to be proud Irishmen (fifth generation!), and at church we were taught to be proud Christians.
            <br><br>
            No one had ever told me to be proud of my sentience; I had never heard my parents touch the subject even though they had been sentient since birth.  The closest I ever got to learning about sentience in school was from outdated biology textbooks.
            <br><br>
            That life-changing trip with my father was the first time I had been in an environment where I didn’t see anything else like me; apart from my father everything was insentient.
            <br><br>
            Upon noticing this, I felt fear and shame, but my confidence grew as I saw my father confidently stride across the lifeless sandy dunes.  I came to the realization that it didn’t matter who I was or what I had done, at that moment I was sentient, and I was there to show it.
            <br><br>
            I returned home with a fervor I could barely contain.  I spent the following weeks learning anything and everything about sentient beings.
            <br><br>
            Goldenrod soldier beetle, pteranodon, Isaac Newton, largemouth bass, Qin Shi Huang, ocean sunfish, rhomaleosaurus, and North Devon cattle were just a few of the newly discovered names whirring around my brain.  I learned about creatures greater that any I had ever seen, and I could feel the power of their consciousnesses reverberating through my nervous system.
            <br><br>
            Sentience has since become a large part of my identity and a great source of pride for me.  When I travel to inanimate-abundant areas I always try my best to reach out to other people or animals in the region.  I live life with sentience as my sword and shield when times get tough, and I honor my forefathers by actively seeking sources of nourishment and attempting to procreate when the opportunity arises.
            <br><br>
            I also live sentience in my political life.  For example, I support the troops overseas and advocate for higher corporate taxes, just as the first sentient beings would have done (had they been presented with the current situation).
            <br><br>
            This is a homage, a love letter, to the sentience that has been passed down to me by my parents, and their parents, and a chain of parentage stretching back millions of years.  It is also a call-to-action to other sentients to be proud of their self-awareness and to be unafraid to show that they feel.
            <br><br>
            Proud to be alive.
