            ATLANTA, GA - "Losers live in the past. Winners learn from the past and enjoy working in the present toward
            the future" -
            Denis Waitley, author of <i>The Psychology of Winning</i>.
            <br><br>
            The world is more competitive than ever, and a select handful of people have figured out the formula to
            thrive in it, have you?
            <br><br>
            While the investment hobbyist look at the future for inspiration - crypto, cannabis futures, renewables -
            the real bears and bulls are learning their lessons from history. I'm not talking about housing, index
            funds, or (<i>ugh</i>) bonds; there's only so much you can get from yesterday's reheated lunch.
            <br><br>
            <b>Babylonia</b>
            <br><br>
            The Ancient World holds innumerable secrets that are only now being rediscovered by humanity. The ingenuity
            of Egyptian architects, the skill of Greek sculptors, and of course the prowess of Babylonian businessmen.
            <br><br>
            Only 2% of excavated Babylonian clay tablets have been deciphered, yet modern investors seem oblivious to
            the revolution in knowledge that they offer.
            <br><br>
            Here are just a few of the <i>rich</i> habits you can start today.
            <br><br><br>
            <b>1. Invest In Your Tools</b>
            <div class="inlineQuoteSmall">
                [x] minas, 24 shekels silver, campaign equipment for cavalry soldiers of the royal reserve(?), [for] 3
                years:
                <br>
                1 mule, bought from Ina-Esagil-lisa for 50 shekels silver;<br><br>
                36 shekels for the mule's fodder; 12 blankets; 12 cuirasses; 12 helmets; 12 travel bags; 12 pairs of
                shoes; 1 pi oil, 2 pi salt, 2 pi cress,<br>
                equipment for 3 years, counting from Nisanu of year 9, has been given to Remut-Bel, Itti-Shamash-balatu
                and Akkadaia, who are leaving on campaign.<br><br>
                | Babylonian tablet Dar.253, Babylon 513BC, translated by Joannes, 1982 |
            </div>
            This passage reveals the importance the successful Babylonians placed on buying quality equipment. Novice
            investors maybe gasp at the apparent excess spending incurred on campaign equipment, but any veteran
            investor will recognize that this is a three year investment with low depreciation and a high multiyear
            ROI.<br><br>
            Rich investors aren't buying cheap Chinese knock-offs, they're purchasing equipment that will
            last.<br><br><br>
            <b>2. Don't Stop Networking</b>
            <div class="inlineQuoteSmall">
                To my sisters Taru and Tabi from your brother(s) Nabusha and Makkibanit. We have blessed you by Ptah
                that he may show me your face in peace.
                <br>...<br>
                And why is it that you have not sent me a letter? As for me, a snake bit me and I was dying and you did
                not send (to enquire) if I was alive or dead. I have sent this letter (to enquire) about your
                welfare.<br><br>
                | Aramaic papyrus, Hermopolis 600-500BC, translated by Bresciani and Hamil, 1966 |
            </div>
            Didn't hear back from your main prospective investor? Forgot to send your account broker a Christmas card?
            It's not too late.<br><br>
            Networking isn't a job, it's a lifestyle.<br><br>Keep your foot in the door and reopen any doors that might
            have closed while you were too busy checking today's stock ratings; it worked for the ancient Babylonians
            and it'll work for you.<br><br><br>
            <b>3. Avoid Bad Influences</b>
            <div class="inlineQuoteSmall">
                It is said that, on the second stage of the journey from Persian Susa to Media, there is such a mass of
                scorpions that, when the Persian king is going to be passing that way, he gives orders three days in
                advance that they be chased away.
                <br><br>| Aelian, De Naturo Animalium 15.26 |
            </div>
            Know what you like and tolerate nothing less than that.<br>If you want to succeed, you need to set up the
            environment that will let you do that which may mean anything from eating better to chasing away the
            scorpions in your life.<br><br><br>
            <b>4. Know How To Handle Defeat</b>
            <div class="inlineQuoteSmall">
                1 mina silver with 1/8 (impurity) per shekel of nuhhutu-quality, (paid) instead of the equipment for an
                expedition and the travel provisions, as much as is the share due from Marduk-nasir-apli, father of
                Nidinti-Bel, until the end of Addaru of year 46 of King Darius, Nabu-ahhe-buillt, son of
                Itti-Marduk,balatu, descendant of Egibi, has received from Nidinti-Bel, son of Marduk-nasir-apli.
                <br><br>| Babylonian tablet BM 33928, Babylon 486BC, translated by Abraham, 2004 |
            </div>
            There's no glory in sinking with the ship, sometimes you accept your losses and be like Marduk-nasir-apli,
            father of Nidinti-Bel and pay the forfeit<br><br>
            Oh, and next time don't make promises you can't uphold.<br><br><br>
            <b>5. Eat Red Meat</b>
            <div class="inlineQuoteSmall">
                90 sheep, allocations by Kampiya, Zishshawish received for rations. In months X and XI, for a total
                period of 2 months, daily he receives 1 sheep and half of a sheep, in year 19.<br>Hintamukka wrote. He
                received the dumme from Ripish.
                <br><br>| Elamite tablet PF 678, Persepolis 503BC |
            </div>
            The final lesson and most important lesson that Ancient Babylon has bestowed upon us is that of eating red
            meat.<br><br>Red meat boost B12, keeps red blood cells healthy, helps build muscle, and, most importantly,
            increases testosterone<br>The Babylonians had a preference for lamb and mutton, but anything a vegan
            wouldn't eat will probably do.<br><br>
            There are new tablets been translated everyday so keep checking in for more, happy investing!
