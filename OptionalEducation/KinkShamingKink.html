            NEW YORK CITY, NY - I'm Lisa, and I have a confession to make: kink shaming is my kink. Yes, you read that
            right. In a city known for its open-mindedness and acceptance of diverse lifestyles, I understand that my
            kink might seem paradoxical, even controversial. But I'm here to explain my perspective and why I believe
            kink shaming, when done consensually, is a legitimate and valid form of kink.
            <br><br>
            Kink shaming, for those out of the loop, is about condemning someone's sexual preferences. It's about
            challenging what they believe to be the source of sexual enjoyment and exposing how strange, whacky, or even
            unnacceptable their ideas may be. When done right, it's a powerful dynamic of psychological play and power
            exchange.
            <br><br>
            Now for my side of the story: The act of kink shaming, for me, is intensely arousing. It's the combination
            of verbal domination and the complex interplay of boundaries that gets my heart racing. It's about genuine
            judgment; it's intense and raw.
            <br><br>
            And of utmost importance, <span class="bold">not everything can be a kink.<br/><br/></span>
            Since sexual liberation opened the floodgates of the belief that "anything can be a kink", the kink community has been corrupted with outrageous concepts - book-binding vore? meteorology role-play? vegan low-environmnetal impact vampire BDSM?  The list could truly extend for miles.  
            <br><br>
            Not everything should be classified as a kink just because someone enjoys it. There needs to be a framework,
            a set of criteria that includes enjoyment and rationality - the same way that not any animal can be a
            reptile, not any machine is a car, and not every grape juice is wine. 
            <br><br>
            Some appreciate my honesty and the nuanced conversation my perspective brings to the forefront.  Others have felt uncomfortable about having their fragile desires being thrust into the spotlight. My stance challenges us to think critically about what we accept and why - and I can't get enough of it.
            <br><br>
            This type of thrilling logic-play of weeding out the made-up magoos from the true kinksters is what truly arouses me and, lucky for me, there's a lot of material to work with.  You can imagine that in the bedroom most of my partners at one time or another have grown exhausted or even overwhelmed, needed a breather, from the relentless adjudication and reviews, but hey; that's just my kink, love it or lose it.
            <br><br>
            It's a provocative stance, but one that invites deeper reflection on human sexuality and the limits of our desires. So, kink shaming remains my kink, a paradox that keeps me excited and engaged in the ever-evolving landscape of erotic exploration.
