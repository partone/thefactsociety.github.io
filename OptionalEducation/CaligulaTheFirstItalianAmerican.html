            Providence, RI - Robert De Niro, Frank Sinatra, Leonardo DiCaprio, Sylvester Stallone, Joe Pesci - all household names that continue a long and proud history of Italians and their descendants making their mark on the New World.  Cemented as the achievements of Italian Americans are today, their exact origin is controversial and there is much debate surrounding who the first Italian American was.
            <br><br>
            Some celebrate 1776 as, not only the birth of the United States, but the year that Italian Americans were thrust into existence, however, Italians had inhabited the <i>Americas</i> for centuries prior to the US Declaration of Independence.
            <br><br>
            Others point to Pietro Cesare Alberti, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Cesare_Alberti" target="_blank">first Italian to permanently reside in the Americas</a> in 1635.  Perhaps the title of first Italian American should go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerigo_Vespucci" target="_blank">Amerigo Vespucci</a>, America's eponymous explorer, or maybe to Christopher Columbus himself, the first Italian to reach America's shores.
            <br><br>
            I believe that the first person to truly hold the title of Italian American was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula" target="_blank">Caligula</a>.  Yes, <i>that</i> Caligula.
            <br><br>
            You're probably asking yourself if Caligula was even Italian American?  Before you start calling me a <i>jamoke</i>, hear me out.
            <br><br>
            It's true that Italy didn't unify until the 1860s but since when does that make someone Italian?  <i>Italianness</i> doesn't come from the Italian government; <i>Italianness</i> comes from its land and the culture it has cultivated - from huge family gatherings to celebrate your nephew's tenth birthday, to fraternizing with the other families after Sunday mass, to enjoying the best bowl of <i>fraggiol</i> you've ever eaten, courtesy of <i>la nonna</i> - and all this wealth of deep-rooted tradition existed long before Italy emerged as a republic.
            <br><br>
            In fact, Caligula's parents were born in (modern-day) Italy in the early first century AD.  For at least six generations before him (though probably longer), Emperor Caligula's ancestors lived and died in the <i>bel paesa</i>.  Italian American enough for you?
            <br><br>
            Now, with that out of the way, let's get started.  The ISDA (Italian Sons and Daughters of America) define <a href="https://orderisda.org/culture/la-nostra-voce/what-makes-us-italian-american/" target="_blank">three essential elements</a> to being Italian American beyond simply having Italian heritage:
            <div class="inlineQuote">a deep and abiding sense of family, a strong work ethic and a centuries-long devotion to our Catholic faith</div>
            <br>
            Let's start with <i>la famiglia</i>.
            <br><br>
            After Tiberius unjustly imprisoned Caligula's mother and brother in 31 AD, Caligula went so far as to plan to kill Tiberius in his very own bed chamber, only to enter the room and abandon the plan, showing that a true Italian wouldn't do harm upon another in their own home.
            <br><br>However, with the unity of his family still at stake, Suetonius writes that Caligula aided in killing Tiberius at a later date, thus avenging his mother and brother.  That's one memorable family man.
            <br><br>
            Finally, let's talk about work ethic.<br><br>Caligula had that Italian <i>je ne sais quoi</i> that has made Italian Americans such recognized and valued members of modern society.  Italian Americans in ancient society were no different.
            <br><br>
            Caligula never took a day off - or at least that's what you would think when viewing everything he achieved during his four year reign.  He completed great works such as the temple of Augustus, the circus of Gaius and Nero racetrack, and the theater of Pompey.  Being an Italian American through and through, he wasn't one to rebuff a challenge; he successfully conquered Mauretania (modern-day northwestern Africa) and even attempted to expand into Britannia.
            <br><br>
            Sadly though, he met his tragic end when he was assassinated by a group of his very own guardsmen of northern Italian descent.  <i>Chepreca</i>!  Nevertheless, his memory lives on through his deeds.
            <br><br>
            Speaking as an Italian American, I believe that it is important that, when we look for inspiration and guidance, we don't let Hollywood actors playing characters on-screen overshadow what flesh and bone working-class Italian Americans have achieved; that we turn our gaze towards true examples of what it means to be Italian American: Joe DiMaggio, Lee Iacocca, Anthony Fauci, Antonin Scalia, and so on.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, that we remember the thousands of Italian Americans who never achieved fame, whose stories exist only in black and white photographs and tales passed down through generations, but who nevertheless worked hard to guarantee their children's children's children a better life.  Ultimately, that we remember how it all began: with a few brave souls, Caligula and other first generation Italians, who left in search of something new.
            <br><br>
            Next time you're sat at home in front of the TV eating New York-style ravioli, give a thought to Caligula and remember that America wouldn't have been the same without him.
