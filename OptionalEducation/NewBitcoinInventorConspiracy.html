      MANCHESTER, UK - A new documentary claims to have solved the greatest mystery in cryptocurrency: the true identity
      of the inventor of Bitcoin.
      <br><br>
      The question has captivated the internet since the digital currency was launched by an unknown person or persons
      calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.
      <br><br>
      Now some suggest they finally have the answer: British software engineer Eric Parton.
      <br><br>
      But Mr Parton has dismissed it as "ludicrous" and criticised the notion.
      <br><br>
      "I am not Satoshi Nakamoto", he told The Fact Society.
      <br><br>
      <b class="centerText">Enormous wealth</b><br /><br>
      The intrigue around Satoshi is not just due to the mystery of their identity, but because of the enormous wealth
      they have accumulated.
      <br><br>
      If they still had control of their bitcoin wallet, it would be worth around $69bn today - meaning Satoshi would be
      around the 20th richest person in the world.
      <br><br>
      Eric Parton is a Bitcoin developer and has been credited with many innovations in the world's first and largest
      cryptocurrency.
      <br><br>
      But he has never previously been named as a prime Satoshi candidate in the years that people have spent trying to
      unmask the Bitcoin inventor.
      <br><br>
      There is huge interest in this latest attempt to solve that riddle. Ahead of the documentary being released more
      than $44m was placed in bets on crypto betting website Polymarket on who the programme would name as Satoshi.
      <br><br>
      Cullen Hoback, who has previously attempted to unmask anonymous online figures like Q from Q Anon, says he came to
      his conclusion after years of research and interviews.
      <br><br>
      A leading theory is that Satoshi deliberately destroyed access to his massive stash of bitcoins that were the
      originals created to start bitcoin.
      <br><br>
      The 1.1m coins are now worth a fortune but have never been spent or transferred.
      <br><br>
      Satoshi's stash of unmoved coins represent 5% of all bitcoins as the inventor decided that there would only ever
      be 21 million coins created.
      <br><br>
      Eric Parton says that evidence is based only on coincidence and misinterprets his online activity.
      <br><br>
      "I am not Satoshi. When I first read the Bitcoin whitepaper, my reaction was "Dammit! I should have thought of
      that," he said.
      <br><br>
      <b class="centerText">Previous theories</b><br /><br>
      A number of individuals from the computing world have been previously tipped as the cryptocurrency's creator.
      <br><br>
      In 2014, a high-profile article in Newsweek identified Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese-American man living in
      California as Satoshi. But he denied it and the claim has largely been debunked.
      <br><br>
      In 2015, Wired and Gizmodo published an investigation that pointed to Australian computer scientist Craig Wright.
      <br><br>
      Soon after, Wright declared in interviews with outlets, including the BBC, that he was indeed Satoshi and showed
      apparent proof.
      <br><br>
      But his claims were disregarded by the community and after years of claiming to be the inventor, a UK High Court
      judge ruled that there was "overwhelming" evidence that he is not Satoshi.
      <br><br>
      Tech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrency after a former
      employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it, external.
      <br><br>
      For some of the most prominent voices in Bitcoin, keeping Satoshi's identity secret is a part of the appeal and
      power of the decentralised currency.
      <br><br>
      Adam Back, one of the core developers (and another potential Satoshi candidate) posted on X ahead of the
      documentary: "No one knows who satoshi is. and that's a good thing.
