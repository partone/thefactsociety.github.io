            CANCUN, MX - I was 25, I had just bought a house with my seven-figure salary that I earned off of my
            15-hour-workweek tech job - and I left it all behind.
            <br><br>
            In the summer of 2016, I graduated from a no-name university with unremarkable grades and a degree in CS. I
            had
            lived in Ohio my entire life and I saw my degree, mediocre as it was, as an opportunity to show the world
            what I
            was made of, and in the process see what the world was made of. Throughout my entire higher education, I had
            been sold the dream of the legendary tech job demand surplus but, like many recent CS graduates, I was hit
            with
            the hard reality that the tech giants were hiring - but they weren't hiring you. I entered a four-month
            chain of
            tech interviews and tech rejections and it was taking its toll on my self-esteem...until a small
            start-up based in Central Asia reached out to me.
            <br><br>
            They had taken interest in my internship experience that had involved some blockchain which, in reality, had
            only involved two weeks of superficial investigation into mining hardware optimization. Nevertheless, I
            interviewed with them and made enough of an impression that they extended me an offer. The job was to set up
            a Bitcoin mining operation for the Taliban in order to help them invest anonymously and, while neither the
            role
            nor the organization particularly attracted me, the pay and benefits did. The contract stated that I would
            earn an annual salary of $318,000 a year with bonuses as well as quarterly Bitcoin payouts. On top of
            that, the Taliban were offering to pay for my housing, relocation, and would even split half of the bill if
            I
            chose to pursue a master's degree. It felt like dream.
            <br><br>
            My parents were elated but not without their concerns. My father voiced worries about the vague wording
            around
            the amount of paid-time-off I would receive, while my mother brought up the advent of radical Islam in the
            region. I understood their fears but I was at a point in life where I wanted a change, I <i>needed</i> a
            change,
            and this was the chance I had been scouring pages and pages of job listings for.
            <br><br>
            I accepted the offer and my recruiter put me in contact with a relocation specialist to start the moving
            process.
            <br><br>
            Fast forward four years and I was thriving. I had lived through the crypto boom of 2017 and was gently
            coming
            down off 2019's mid-summer burst. Trump was doing wonders for company morale after his announcement of
            withdrawal
            of American troops from Afghanistan and I was finally getting to grips with the local language. The only
            thing
            missing was happiness.
            <br><br>
            'What?!', I hear you exclaim. At that point in my career money was pouring in faster than I could spend it,
            was
            I not living 'the dream'?
            Weekends in Dubai and week-long getaways to Jakarta were making me feel empty. The honeymoon period of
            eating
            qabili palau while exploring downtown Kabul had long ago ended and I had forgotten why I had moved. I had
            travelled to Afghanistan to make money and explore the world and at that point, money no longer seemed like
            an
            incentive and Kabul seemed more like the capital of a decadent third world country than the image of a
            pristine
            Islamic Caliphate that had initially been impressed upon me.
            <br><br>
            The Taliban Bitcoin mining operation had evolved from a team of three engineers to an entire legion of
            accountants, supply chain analysts, network administrators, and summer interns. I had become an
            anthropomorphic
            mining rig performing seemingly pointless calculations to generate intangible revenue for my corporation.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the ethical implications of the work I was doing for the Taliban were beginning to weigh
            heavily on
            my conscience. They enjoyed giving off the impression of being an environmentally conscious organization but
            internally they were being powered by an unoiled fossil fuel burning cryptocurrency mining operation that I
            had
            helped establish.
            <br><br>
            There was no final straw for me, it was months of 'Am I happy?'' boomeranging around my head until
            it finally settled comfortably on that fact that I was not happy. In the summer of 2020, amidst the COVID-19
            pandemic, I packed up all of my belongings, said my goodbyes, and took a one way flight to Tokyo where I was
            to
            spend the next three months experiencing Japanese culture and planning out my next steps.
            <br><br>
            These days I'm living it out in Cancun; I've opened up a coffee shop here. It's not as flashy as my high
            paying
            tech job - longer hours and more stress for sure - but happiness isn't exclusively a derivative of how
            prestigious your company is, how much you make, or how long you work, currently for me it comes from being
            able
            to lay low and watch the world go by.
            <br><br>
            What is a dream job anyway? I think a lot of us confuse <i>dream jobs</i> with <i>jobs that can support our
                dream lifestyle</i>. Real dream jobs probably exist somewhere out there, but mining crypto for the
            Taliban
            isn't one
            of them.
