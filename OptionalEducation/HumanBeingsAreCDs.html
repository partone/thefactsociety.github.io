            MOOSE JAW, SK - For too long the masses have remained silent about the true nature of our beings, and I don’t understand why. Clearly it’s not about acceptance, as I believe most if not all rational human beings can clearly see that we are all little more than CD players wrapped around flesh and skin.
            <br><br>
            No, dear reader.
            <br><br>
            The issue is that in common discourse it is so rare for someone to bring up our Compact Disc existence. But we’re all thinking about it! After all, how could we not when the fact that we are all CDs is why there are so many issues with the human mind. Have you ever walked into a room and forgotten why you were there?
            <br><br>
            The answer is simple: a scratch on your disc. Our memories are so fallible and malleable due to the fragile medium from which they are read. Just like you can’t expect to use a CD for decades without any scratches, so too can you not expect to use your memory without it coming out worst for ware on the other side. In fact, just as humans use toothpaste for our oral health, scratches on non-human CDs can actually be alleviated through the use of that same memory strengthening paste.
            <br><br>
            Déjà vu, another “mysterious” phenomena in the human existence, is obviously just a jostle in our CD drives that cause us to skip ahead a couple seconds on the disc. Yet we must pretend that we “don’t know” what causes Deja Vu because people are not talking enough about us being little more than fancy walk men.
            <br><br>
            When out with friends, it’s more often than not myself who has to bring up the topic of all of us being CDs, and I don’t understand why that must be. We’re all thinking it! Our CD players are all reading the same information yet I’m the only one who’s actually letting the sounds of the CD leap from my acrylic to my mouth and give sound to my recordings.
            <br><br>
            Even when out at a concert, or a nightclub with a DJ, no one talks about our discs. But how else would we all be so entranced in the music if it were not for the DJ deftly playing with our CDs. In fact, if this were not the case, music would be unintelligible garbage to us.
            <br><br>
            And so, I must urge everyone reading this to not be so uninterested in your own being that you do not bring up being a CD in polite conversation. It’s time we collectively unite our innate polycarbonate-based knowledge and let the world hear our song.
