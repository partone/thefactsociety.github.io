        Bend, OR - The Beatles turned everything they touched to gold. They wooed us with their catchy melodies and won our hearts with their eternal
        wisdom. Each of them taught love and understanding as a band and as solo artists throughout the 60s and 70s - however, are Paul, John, George,
        and Ringo's teachings still relevant to the modern world?<br /><br />
        As cryptocurrency and its offspring spread throughout the globe just as Beatlemania did sixty years ago, we're going to take a moment to
        remember The Beatles' legacy and try to understand what their take on crypto investment would be if any of them were alive today.<br /><br /><br />

        John Lennon was smart and adventurous, never one to shy away from new experiences. He believed in the power of decentralization, as can be
        seen in much of his artistic expression. For example, take the following excerpt from his hit song, Imagine:
        <div class="inlineQuoteSmall">
          Imagine there's no countries<br />
          It isn't hard to do<br />
        </div>
        Clearly he is hinting at some system of decentralizion that simply didn't exist during his time, but that exists in the form of crypto assets
        today. In fact, John goes on to sing,
        <div class="inlineQuoteSmall">
          You may say I'm a dreamer<br />
          But I'm not the only one<br />
          I hope someday you'll join us<br />
        </div>
        which harks ahead to the current struggle of modern crypto influencers to promote and educate the beauty of the cryptosphere.<br /><br />
        <span class="bold">Verdict<br /></span>Yes, John Lennon would have been an early crypto adopter and a versatile crypto native.<br /><br />

        George Harrison was a quiet one, an independent soul. He wrote several songs with the band which deal with questioning authority and asking
        where man's true nature lies. If any Beatle would have understood the importance of the anonymity and liberty that crypto brings, it would
        have been George. Specifically, the song <i>Think For Yourself</i> may have been a subtle nod towards the idea of a decentralized currency and
        the resistance that there would be to its adoption:
        <div class="inlineQuoteSmall">
          Although your mind's opaque<br />
          Try thinking more if just for your own sake<br />
          The future still looks good<br />
        </div>
        <span class="bold">Verdict<br /></span>Cool, calm, and crypto. George would have bought into the smaller currencies and held them to the moon,
        knowing precisely when to sell.<br /><br />
        <span class="bold">Likely Investments<br /></span>Sentinel (SENT), Curio (CUR), other newer currencies <br /><br /><br />
        <b>Paul</b><br /><br />

        Confidence and leadership are what Paul McCartney brought to The Beatles. <br /><br />It's no secret that all crypto investment scenes have
        had huge leaps just as they have had great falls, and that it is down to a small group of diamond-hand pioneers to turn the world on to
        crypto, for the benefit of all to come.<br /><br />Paul was a man who knew what he wanted and would settle for nothing less, not afraid to
        ride through a storm to get it. He also believed in helping the world and his countless charity efforts undoubtedly left the world a better
        place. He encompassed all of the fundamental qualities of the top crypto investors of today, and if he had lived longer he likely would have
        joined them. <span class="bold">Verdict<br /></span>Paul would have led the crypto scene, showing leadership and investment in the largest
        coins of the day. <i>Don't let me down</i>.<br /><br />
        <span class="bold">Likely Investments<br /></span>Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH)<br /><br /><br />
        <b>Ringo</b><br /><br />

        Ringo Starr was the imaginative genius behind "Octopus's Garden", "Don't Pass Me By", and dozens of other of The Beatles' top hits. Often
        regarded as unconventional or confused, Ringo always followed through with results that blew the minds of even the most forward-thinking fans
        with his enlightened creations.<br /><br />
        Although heavily based in tech, crypto is seeing a surge of creative voices supporting it and, likewise, is finding newer and better ways to
        use crypto as a form of expression and diversity. These are the beliefs that Ringo stood for and evoked in songs he wrote such as "Come
        Together" and "All You Need Is Love".<br /><br />
        <span class="bold">Verdict<br /></span>If Rigno were alive today, he would have been a staunch supporter of crypto and crypto spaces, even if
        he couldn't fully wrap his head around them.<br /><br />
        <span class="bold">Likely Investments<br /></span>Ethereum-backed NFTs, possibly Zilliqa-backed NFTs<br /><br /><br />
        <b>Closing</b><br /><br>
        It is perhaps no surprise that The Beatles would have supported the adoption and investment of cryptocurrency if they were with us today.
        Regardless, their voices and their message continue to ring out through the halls of every mining rig and digital wallet on the net - a
        rallying call for unity, for emboldenment, and for big gains!
