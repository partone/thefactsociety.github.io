        Bend, OR - The Beatles turned everything they touched to gold. They wooed us with their catchy melodies and won our hearts with their eternal
        wisdom. Each of them taught love and understanding as a band and as solo artists throughout the 60s and 70s - however, are Paul, John, George,
        and Ringo's teachings still relevant to the modern world?<br /><br />
        As crypotcurrency and its offspring spread throughout the globe just as Beatlemania did sixty years ago, we're going to take a moment to
        remember The Beatles' legacy and try to understand what their take on crypto investment would be if any of them were alive today.<br /><br /><br />
        <b>John</b><br /><br />
        John Lennon was smart and adventerous, never one to shy away from new experiences. He believed in the power of decentralization, as can be
        seen in much of his artistic expression. For example, take the following excerpt from his hit song, Imagine:
        <div class="inlineQuoteSmall">
          Imagine there's no countries<br />
          It isn't hard to do<br />
        </div>
        Clearly he is hinting at some system of decentralizion that simply didn't exist during his time, but that exists in the form of cryptoassets
        today. In fact, John goes on to sing,
        <div class="inlineQuoteSmall">
          You may say I'm a dreamer<br />
          But I'm not the only one<br />
          I hope someday you'll join us<br />
        </div>
        which harks ahead to the current struggle of modern crypto influencers to promote and educate the beauty of the cryptosphere.<br /><br />
        <span class="bold">Verdict<br /></span> Yes, John Lennon would have been an early crypto adopter and a versatile crypto native.<br />
        Investments: Bitcoin (BTC), BizzCoin (BIZZ)
        <br /><br /><br />
        <b>George</b><br /><br />
        George Harrison was a quiet one, an independent soul who in today's terms would be described as a "sigma".  He wrote several songs with the band which deal with questioning authority and asking where man's true nature lies.  If any 
        <span class="bold">Verdict<br /></span>Cool, calm, and crypto. George would have bought into the smaller currencies and held them to the moon,
        knowing precisely when to sell.<br />Investments: Sentinel (SENT), Curio (CUR)
