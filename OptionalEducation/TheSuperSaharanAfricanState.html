            ANN ARBOR, MI - North Africa, or as I will be referring to it from this point on, Super-Saharan Africa, is composed of six countries (excluding Western Sahara).
            <br><br>
            The region is not only united by geography, but also by a common religion, Islam, a common language, Arabic (though dialects differ by geography), and for being the wealthies area of the continent.
            <br><br>
            It is a region of the world that has been united several times, in different combinations, under different rulers.  The Roman Empire, the Abbasid Caliphate, the Fatmid Caliphate, and others have succeeded in united, at least in part, Super-Saharan Africa.
            <br><br>
            But what would a unified Super Saharan African State look like today?  Who would it benefit?  Could it <i>even</i> be done?<br><br>
            I dreamt up the idea of the Super Saharan African State (SSAS) two nights ago.  I was out boating with my friends, Jimmy and Louis, and, as we gently bobbed on the calm lake, our conversation meandered over to the topic of the African Continental Free Trade Area, an ambitious and somewhat successful initiative to unite the African continent under a single free trade agreement.
            <br><br>
            It's unclear how long the conversation had been going on for or how we had even reached that topic, but as we were reaching a consensus over the benefits of the ACAFTA on sub-Saharan Africa, Jimmy said something that caught us all off-guard - "What about Super-Saharan Africa?".
            <br><br>
            We both knew what he meant, but the new term he had just coined for North Africa had us in tears.
            <br><br>
            Between guffaws and cackles, someone spat out the phrase "Super-Saharan African State" and thus the idea was born - and our cascade of laughter became torrential.
            <br><br>
            We laughed for what seemed like hours, our boat gradually morphing into a submarine.  At some point a third character joined us and the conversation drifted to new waters, undoubtedly touching a plethora of much more forgettable topics throughout the remainder of the night.<br><br>When I woke up, I wrote down "Super Saharan African State" but the enigma of what made it such a humorous idea has been lost to the dream.
