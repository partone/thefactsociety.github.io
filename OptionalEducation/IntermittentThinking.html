      GENEVA, CH - We sat down with Dr. Johannesburg Jones, a leading expert in neurology and thought pattern
      research at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a>, to discuss his work on
      <span class="bold">Intermittent
        Thinking.</span>
      <br><br>
      With extensive experience and pioneering research, Dr. Johannesburg has contributed significantly to our
      understanding of the human brain. In our session with him, we discussed the latest developments in his field and
      gained a unique perspective on the new lifestyle that is making ~brain~ waves across the youth.

      <span class="bold">Doctor JJ, it is a privilege to be able to talk to you today.</span>
      <div class="inlineQuote">
        Dr. Johannesburg: It's a pleasure to meet you Robert! I love your work with The Fact Society, that site is truly
        cutting edge in the field of knowledge. [Editor's Note: That's a fact.]
      </div>

      <span class="bold">Would you start us off with a brief introduction to the concept of “Intermittent
        Thinking?”</span>
      <div class="inlineQuote">
        Of course! I think the simplest way of explaining it is that Intermittent Thinking is to the mind what
        Intermittent Fasting is to the gut. People are very aware of dieting fads as they can keep our bodies healthy,
        and maybe help us lose a few pounds. But what I've been proposing is a dieting fad for the mind, and even the
        ability to trim some thought fat. In extreme forms of the practice, participants have been able to reduce their
        thinking down to OTAD [one thought a day].
      </div>

      <span class="bold">Now Doctor, when you say “thought fat” what exactly are you referring to?</span>
      <div class="inlineQuote">
        As humans, we all carry around a lot of dead weight in our minds which we've labeled as “thoughts”. You see,
        humans were never supposed to evolve thinking. Modern science tells us that thinking is merely a side product of
        necessary brain functions, such as finding the nearest toilet or playing hackysack.
      </div>

      <span class="bold">But tell me Doc, if we didn't think then how could we live our lives? Would we be able to talk?
        To dream? To love?</span>
      <div class="inlineQuote">
        Well Rob, these are the very questions we are grappling with in our research. Just as intermittent thinking may
        reduce body fat percentage, leading to a ripped bod, so too does intermittent thinking lead to a ripped brain
        with the folds in our brains becoming even deeper. Unlocking powers hitherto unknown to mankind. Just the other
        day I swear I could read people's minds as I walked down the street since my own mind was fully deprived of
        thought.
      </div>

      <span class="bold">Could you read my thoughts right now?</span>
      <div class="inlineQuote">
        Yes, but I don't want to.
      </div>

      <span class="bold">I respect that. So, Doctor, what do you think is the end result of Intermittent Thinking? It
        has
        seen widespread adoption by users of Internet, but do you think even the common man may adopt this
        practice?</span>
      <div class="inlineQuote">
        Oh undoubtedly so. I believe it is a drive within every human to not think thoughts, and while I may have
        popularized this idea in modern society, it is clear that similar practices have been around for millennia all
        around the world. Take the caveman as an example: archaeologists have no record of their writing because they
        were too busy not thinking to care for the written word. And if the caveman can do it, then by God, so can
        modern man. I'll make sure of it!
      </div>

      <span class="bold">Well Doctor, you've convinced this esteemed journalist on the benefits of intermittent
        thinking! Thank you for gracing us with your time tonight, and I'll think you later ;) </span>
      <div class="inlineQuote">
        I'll be taking no more questions.
      </div>

      <div id="closingStatement">Doctor Johannesburg Jones disappeared from the mind's eye after this interview and has
        not been heard of since. We dedicate this article to you Doctor. Godspeed. </div>
