      Cuernavaca, MX - <span class="bold">His Game of Lives</span> is one of the feature length films hitting the big
      screen at the <a href="https://pvifilmfestival.org/">Puerto Vallarta Independent Film
        Festival</a> later this year. It represents a labor of love for a cast and crew of largely newcomers to the film
      industry.<br><br>This is director Eric Parton's first feature length film and is a collaboration between writers
      and
      producers from both Mexico and the United States.<br><br>We spoke to Serena Biosfera who is the lead writer for
      His
      Game of Lives to hear an insider perspective of the film and its production.<br><br><br>

      <span class="bold">Justin Goldberg: In your own words, what is the story His Game of Lives is looking to
        tell?</span>
      <div class="inlineQuote">
        Serena Biosfera: The movie is a departure from what audiences are used to seeing. We wanted to create a story
        that was relatable while still being firmly rooted in an abstract world. The main characters, Liewen Ludo and
        Alexis Mentiros, are opposing forces in the nightclub scene. One of them is the kind of person you bump into at
        the
        start of the night who's mellow and friendly while the other is more like the person you find pouring out the
        drinks and buying rounds for strangers. It creates such a strange energy, an almost mysterious aura when they
        meet that I think audiences will be left speechless by the subtext. [Laughs]
      </div>
      <span class="bold"><br>What were the largest challenges in filming such a complex production?</span>
      <div class="inlineQuote">
        Serena Biosfera: Apart from COVID which halted our production for almost 12 months? Probably the filming
        location. Right from its inception, we knew that this was a story that could only happen in New York, it just
        made sense. However, due to visa and licensing issues almost all the filming was done right here [gestures] in
        Cuernavaca. Capturing the vibe of New York City and teleporting it over here took its toll on all the crew.
        [Laughs]
      </div>
      <span class="bold"><br>That's awesome. The title, His Game of Lives, seems to suggest something very ominous may
        be on the horizon; how did you settle on the title?</span>
      <div class="inlineQuote">
        Serena Biosfera: Yes! Social manipulation plays a large role in the movie, especially since so much of it is set
        in a nightclub. Plus, near the end of the movie it's revealed that the driving force behind everything that has
        been going wrong is a sort of metaphysical being called 'His', so at that point in writing the screenplay the
        title was a no brainer!
        [Laughs]
      </div>
      <span class="bold"><br>Going back to the 'New York' aspect of filming, what steps did you take to portray New York
        while filming in a separate location?</span>
      <div class="inlineQuote">
        Serena Biosfera: It was all done with practical effects and carefully selected filming locations. I have never
        been to New York specifically, but I was raised in Puebla which is a big city not too far from here, so I took a
        lot of inspiration from that. Ultimately, the story we're telling with His Game of Lives could have happened
        anywhere, so we don't try to lean too heavily into a specific location. Hey, I'm walking here! [Laughs]

      <span class="bold"><br>Thank you very much for speaking with us!<br><br></span>
      <div>His Game of Lives premieres at the <a href="https://pvifilmfestival.org/">Puerto Vallarta Independent Film
