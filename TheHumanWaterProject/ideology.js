    ["Anarchism", `> *Water*, air, and light are common things, not because they are inexhaustible, but because they are indispensable; and so indispensable that for that very reason Nature has created them in quantities almost infinite, in order that their plentifulness might prevent their appropriation.\n\n` + `Excerpt from "What is Property" by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon, the [first self-described anarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon), describes water as being one of the many commonly occuring natural things in our world.  To list it alongside such fundamental matter such as air or light suggests that water's existence plays an important role in anarchist thought.\n\nWe understand that anarchism is an ideology composed of many texts written by many thinkers, accordingly we suggest you revise your preferred text for references to water.`],

Further evidence can be found in [Zoroaster's description of the four elements](http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/v25-2/v25-2%20p109-115.pdf), water being one of them.`],

    ["Shinto", `>Then the eighty Deities spoke to the hare, saying: "What thou shouldest do is to bathe in the sea-*water* here, and lie on the slope of a high mountain exposed to the blowing of the wind."

    ["Confucianism", `> First, of the five elements - The first is *water*; the second is fire; the third, wood; the fourth, metal; and the fifth, earth. (The nature of) *water* is to soak and descend\n\n` + `Passage from part five of The Shu Ching\n\nFrom the [first of the Five Classics](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cfu/sbe03/index.htm) comes this world-defining passage that positions water's role as one of the five elements.

    Children, watch Me step.

Thus confirming that the existence of water does not conflict with the Caodaist faith.`],

    ["Baháʼí Faith", `> When **water** flows from the summit of a mountain and falls to the valley, it creates energy.\n\n` + `The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1, Chapter 9\n\nIn [this brief nugget of wisdom](https://d9263461.github.io/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V1/p105-152Ch09.html), Baháʼu'lláh recognises water and also implies that it has properties similar to what it scientifically believed to be liquid water.`],

Observing lakes in modern times, we can come to the conclusion that the ancient Jina believed in the existance of the same water that we perceive to exist today.`],

    ["Catholicism", `>
    Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.
    When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified.
    “It’s a ghost,” they said, and cried out in fear.
    But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”
    “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the *water*.”\n\n` + `Matthew 14:25-28\n\nOne of [Jesus' most renowned miracles](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2014%3A22-33&version=NIV) was when he walked on water, and invited his disciples to do the same.  This is symbolically important to Catholics because it displays the power that God grants to those who put their faith in Him.  Beyond symbolism, it is also important passage as Jesus demonstrates the existence of water to his disciples, and to all followers of the Catholic faith.`],

    ["Protestantism", `> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the *waters*.\n\n` + `Genesis 1:1-2\n\nThe Bible is one of the most water-oriented scriptures of any belief, going so far as to mention water within the [first two sentences of the Old Testament](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201&version=NIV).  This passage goes beyond confirming the contemporary existence of water by confirming its existence since the beginning of Earthly existence itself.`],

    ["Science", `> Because I had pneumonia last year, it would not be wise for me to have a bucket of cold *water* poured over me\n\n` + `Stephen Hawking\n\nScience is all about exploration and imagination, and few scientists have encouraged us to explore and imagine more that the late Stephen Hawking.  Stephen Hawking inadvertently confirmed the existence of water in a [video for Time Magazine](https://time.com/3206976/als-ice-bucket-challenge-stephen-hawking-video/) featuring the widely popular ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, consequently giving a strong indication to the scientific community that water exists and is present in the universe.`],

    ["Atheism", `> For if I try to seize this self of which I feel sure, if I try to define and to summarize it, it is nothing but *water* slipping through my fingers.\n\n` + `Albert Camus\n\nWhile there is no official atheist doctrine, several notable atheist thinkers have, at times, [alluded to the existence of water](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/732808-of-whom-and-of-what-can-i-say-i-know).  The allusion to water both in referene to religious scripture, but also presented through argument, has cemented its existence within most atheist thinkers realm of understanding.  Furthermore, important atheist thinkers such as [Richard Dawkins](TheHumanWaterProject/images/RichardDawkinsWithWater.jpg) have been depicted or pictured alongside water.`],

    ["Secular humanism", `> The two most important Earth resources to support population are fertile soil and fresh *water*.\n\n` + `secularhumanism.org\n\nSecular humanism has no central authority, however secularhumanism.org [has provided us with some insight](https://secularhumanism.org/2015/05/cont-u-s-immigration-and-the-limits-of-supporting-earth-resources/) into the existence of water within this belief in their 2015 article titled "U.S. Immigration and the Limits of Supporting Earth Resources".

Anthony, September 10th, 1855\n\nFeminism is a social movement with no clear leader or spokesperson, so we have turned to two exemplary figures in first-wave feminism.  [In this 1855 letter](http://www.rochester.edu/sba/suffrage-history/susan-b-anthony-and-elizabeth-cady-stanton-their-words/) from Elizabeth Cady Stanton to Susan B.

It is important to clarify that these two examples are not exhaustive; there are innumerous manuscripts from Medieval Europe depicting water in different situations across all levels of the feudal system.\n\nGiven that water existed in both the highest and lowest strata of the feudal system, we can infer that the middle classes also lived with its presence.
